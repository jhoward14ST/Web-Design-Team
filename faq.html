 			 <summary>Question 2</summary>
 		 <p><b>How are your meals portioned? </b></p>
<p>
Depending on the meal type, meals are portioned into single serving containers or a ‘family style’
container. All containers are either compostable or reusable/recycle friendly.

 			 <summary>Question 3</summary>
 		 <p><b> Do I need to cook the meals?</b></p>
<p>
Unlike other meal delivery services that require you to prep, wash, chop, and follow complex
instructions, Pure Rae Cooking meals are designed to be 85% finished when it arrives at your
door. This means there is little-to-no cooking needed from your end. All meals require either no
cooking at all or simple instructions to use the stove, oven, or microwave.

 			 <summary>Question 4</summary>
 		 <p><b>How will I know how to pull the meal together? </b></p>
<p> 
Before delivery drop-off, I will email you the upcoming menu and include PDF attachments of
recipe cards for each meal. These instructions are simple and easy to follow.

 			 <summary>Question 5</summary>
 		 <p><b>Do I need to buy any ingredients? </b></p>
<p> 
Nope! Meal kits will provide everything you need. However, it is highly recommended that you
have staple ingredients in your home such as olive oil (or your preferred oil) and salt/pepper. I will
also occasionally suggest optional add-in suggestions, simply as inspiration! You are always
encouraged to customize/adjust your meal kits to make it your own.

 			 <summary>Question 7</summary>
 		 <p><b>Do I pick the meals I get each week?</b></p>
<p>
Currently, I create the weekly meals based on the best products available at that time while
keeping your preferences/eating restrictions in mind. You are always welcome to request specific
meals and encouraged to share feedback if you are ever not satisfied with a meal. In the future, it
is our goal to create a structure where you can pick and choose your menus each week from an
automated system.</p>

 			 <summary>Question 9</summary>
 		 <p><b> Where do you deliver?</b></p>
<p>
At this time, we are able to deliver within a 30-minute radius of our kitchen site located in
Shoreline. On your predetermined day of delivery, you can expect to receive your meals no later
than 5pm. Of course, Seattle traffic is unpredictable so timing will vary based on conditions that
day. We will always communicate with you via email if deliveries are running late. In the future,
we plan to expand our delivery service capabilities farther North, South, and East of downtown
Seattle.

 			 <summary>Question 11</summary>
 		 <p><b>Do I keep the ice packs, cooler bag, and plastic containers? </b></p>
<p> Do I keep the ice packs, cooler bag, and plastic containers?
Pure Rae Cooking is an eco-friendly business. We ask that you return the cooler bag/ice packs
each week on your delivery day by placing it outside your front door for pickup. We also ask that
you kindly wash/wipe out plastic containers so that we may reuse them up to 10 times before
recycling. If you forget to set your materials outside, no problem! I will send you a follow up
reminder to place it outside the following week.
